    <h1>Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2</h1>
    <p>
      HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1.1,
      <br />HTTP1.1 with the keep-alive header, it was possible to have
      persistent connections. <br /><br />It allowed multiple requests/responses
      per TCP connection. <br />Whereas HTTP2 Introduces the concept of
      multiplexing that interleaves the requests and responses without
      head-of-line blocking and does so over a single TCP connection.
      <br /><br />HTTP/2 uses HPACK header compression algorithm that is
      resilient to attacks like CRIME and utilizes static Huffman encoding.
      <br />HTTP1.1 is relatively secure since it uses digest authentication,
      NTLM authentication. <br /><br />Security concerns from previous versions
      will continue to be seen in HTTP/2. However, it is better equipped to deal
      with them due to new TLS features like connection error of type
      Inadequate_Security. <br />Expands on the caching support by using
      additional headers like cache-control, conditional headers like If-Match
      and by using entity tags.<br /><br />
      HTTP/2 With the server push feature if the client finds the resources are
      already present in the cache, it can cancel the pushed stream.
